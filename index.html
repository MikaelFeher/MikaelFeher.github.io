        <h3>About the Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>It will be a 12 week super intense rollercoaster, at the end of which I will be ready for a junior
           development position working with tools like:

          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Javascript</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Ruby</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am 39 years old and attempting to change careers into software development. My first step into the IT-field was actually informationsecurity, which wasn't really for me.
           During the security course I started messing around in Python and found that I really enjoyed programming, so I decided to go for it. And here I am.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>A little more about me</h4>
          <P>I like <em>TED Talks</em>-videos and this is by far my favorite one:</p>
